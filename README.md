- 👋 Hi, I’m @Yashaswini-Sharma
- 👀 I’m interested in collaborating, I love working in groups and I usually take the lead in whichever project I am in. Where I really shine though is following(rarely get the opportunity to).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning DSA and Machine Learning, but at this point I am confident in my ability to learn everything on the spot(Can finally say domains never restrict me).
- 💞️ My favorite experience was working with 40+ students simultaneously on Git and the amount of conflicts we got was insane. If you ever want a team member to get things done feel free to reach out.
- 📫 You can reach out to me through my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yashaswini-sharma-nsut/)
- 😄 Pronouns: I prefer she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: A fun fact about me is that I have attended schools of all 3 major religions. I have studied at a Christian, Muslim and Hindu school. So I have seen a lot of diversity in my life.
